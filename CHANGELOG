Changelog

Version 0.8.7
	+ created README file
	+ created CHANGELOG file
	+ replaced hardcoded wb_* anchors by SEC_ANCHOR
	- removed header block from each file because it's of no use
Version 0.8.6
	+ checks if 'Library Admin' and 'jQuery Initial Library' are installed
	  and copies *.jquery presets to /modules/lib_jquery/presets
	+ upgrade.php does the same as described above, but may overwrite
	  existing presets
	+ in backend, you can choose the preset (e.g. ColorBox, FancyBox, etc.),
	  and an adjusted Droplet Code is placed in the HTML output automatically
	  N.B.: this function requires the plugins to be installed!
	- removed bugs that prevented users from having more than one YAIG section
	  per page
	- removed other little bugs
Version 0.8.5
	+ added extra html classes to thumbnail <ul> to apply different
	  styles if needed (otherwise these classes don't hurt)
	  There are already dummy entries in the frontend.css file
	+ made pagination more accessible by using an unsorted list
	+ if in Showall mode it is now possible to revert to normal gallery view
	- fixed bug regarding HTTP parameter creation
	- removed some more unusued code in view.php
	- removed search.php as it isn't used
Version 0.8.4
	+ added preset for use with LibraryAdmin/LibjQuery and ColorBox Plugin
	  copy that preset to your /modules/lib_jquery/presets/ directory and add
	  the appropriate droplet code to every page where YAIG is used
	  the droplet most likely looks like:
	  [[LibInclude?lib=lib_jquery&preset=yaig-colorbox]]
	+ added backend option 'nolink' which displays just thumbs
	+ added backend option 'random_order': displays images in a random order;
	  if unchecked, they are sorted by filename
Version 0.8.3
	- removed language files for NL and SE as I'm unable to maintain them
	+ several files changed to meet Lepton's module standards
Version 0.8.2
	+ added HTML5 modals to display images with an overlay that does not
	  require JavaScript
	+ automatically re-create thumbs when thumbnail size has changed
	  (works in most cases - for further information see view.php)
Version 0.8.1
	+ added several options to display thumbnails
	: Same as original (longest side equals thumbnail size)
	: Same height
	: Same width
	: Square-sized thumbs (may display just a part of original image)
	: 4:3 ratio (may display just a part of original image)
	: 16:9 ratio (may display just a part of original image)
	+ image titles can be added through a separate file
	  upload a simple text file (*.txt) to you image directory (not thumbs!)
	  which contains a title text every line - YAIG sorts your images by
	  filename so be aware to keep the correct order!
	  N.B. when using 'random_order' (see 0.8.4) titles file is not being loaded
	+ use 'imagedestroy' to keep memory usage low (maybe useful on shared hosts)
	+ properly set width + height of thumbs in HTML to speed up page display
	+ use relative paths to keep html output as small as possible
	+ optimized CSS output for instant visual satisfaction ;-)
	+ optimized HTML output - HTML (almost) validates and is sematically meaningful
	+ optimized and rectified php code
	- removed unnecessary code in view.php
	- removed function for 'inline' display
