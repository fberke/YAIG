Yet Another Image Gallery (YAIG)

YAIG is an image gallery module for WebsiteBaker or Lepton CMS.

With YAIG it's fairly easy to display image galleries on your site. Just upload
your pictures using the media section of your CMS and the choose the folder containing
the images from the YAIG backend.

YAIG offers a variety of forms for creating the thumbnails, which makes it one of
the most versatile galleries out there. And, of course, one of the most beautiful
as it comes with some neat HTML5/CSS3 styles by default!

YAIG offers integration for a variety of LibraryAdmin Colorbox-like plugins (aka Modals)
- all you have to do is to select one of the plugins from a list and YAIG does all the
rest for you.

Some features in short:
- LibraryAdmin integration
- re-creation of thumbs when size has changed
- optional HTML5 modal instead of JavaScript modals
- pagination for big galleries with 'expand all' button
- create link-less galleries (thumbs only)
- optionally includes subfolders
- multiple galleries on the same page are possible
- valid and accessible HTML and CSS

Have fun and thanks for using YAIG!
